This was the project under subject of robotics in which I have explored usage of ROS2 as well as copelliasim where I simulated Thymio robot for exloration of room and identifing the room based on images taken by thymio robot based in CNN i.e. MobilenetV2 pre trained model which is used to identify rooms by passing images taken and by training them under this model,
Where, I was able to see that I was getting perfect result of model around 98% accuracy dueing training also around
